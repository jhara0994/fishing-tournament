AS A TOURNAMENT CHAIR PERSON,
I want a website that: 
1. Shows live standings in the tournament.
2. Allows the standings to be certified by an administrator upon tournament completion.
3. Allows the users to submit the buy-in fee online.
4. Allows me to send winnings directly from the website.

AS A TOURNAMENT PARTICIPANT,
I want a website that :
1. Updates standings live so I can see position.
2. Allows photos of catches to be uploaded for verification.
3. Allows me to see other participant's fish photos. 
4. Allows access to personal analytics - by event, monthly, yearly.
